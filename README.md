## About Me

I'm a CS major and math minor at Cleveland State University, working toward a career in software engineering. As a STEM Peer Tutor for Precalculus, I help students build problem-solving skills while strengthening my own technical communication abilities. My focus is on writing clean code, understanding core algorithms, and applying AI/ML concepts to real-world problems.
